# Basic Network Security Analysis

## Objective

The Basic Network Security Analysis is a guided project offered by coursera which guided me effectively to use Wireshark-a useful tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic. The course covers both encrypted and unencrypted protocols, including RADIUS, HTTP, DNS, Telnet, HTTPS, and SSH. Generating traffic for these protocols and gaining hands-on experience capturing and decrypting HTTPS traffic using a pre-master secret key. This project aims to enhance my understanding of network traffic analysis and secure communications.

### Skills Learned

- Learnt how to troubleshoot with Wireshark, capture Traffic and analyze already captured Traffic.
- Understood how to use Display and Capture Filters.
- Generated, Captured and analyzed both Unencrypted traffic- RADIUS, DNS, HTTP and Telnet as well as Encrypted Traffic- SSH and HTTPS.  
- Enhanced my knowledge of Encrypted and Unencrypted Traffic by decrypting the HTTPS Traffic and also the RADIUS encypted password.
- Development of network security skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Network analysis tool called Wireshark for capturing and examining network traffic.
